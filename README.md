## Prometheus 

<br>Works on Pull format we have to make a specific endpoint for example "/metrics" where we store all endpoints 
<br> 

Cannot horizontally scale(not run on multiple machines)
if you want to scale make differnt Prom services and shard the data
<br>


## Grafana
Prometheus UI is great but Grafana is better<br>
Grafana can fetch data from various data sources
